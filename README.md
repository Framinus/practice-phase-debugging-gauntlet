# Practice Phase Debugging Gauntlet
### Learners Guild

## Installation
1. Fork this repo. 
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill out the variable(s) appropriately.
3. Set up the database and install the npm packages. __WARNING__: If you already have a db named `debugger-gauntlet-pets`, the following command will delete and overwrite it.

`npm run setup`

## The Challenge
1. Load the [top level page](http://localhost:3000)
2. When you click any pet name, it should show the owners for that pet in a different div.
3. It doesn't (for many, many reasons). Fix it.
4. Bonus: Write tests to make it easier to determine the sources of the issues.
